## 🏗️ What I'm Learning

- Fundamentals of **Distributed Systems**
- **Cluster Coordination** and consensus algorithms (e.g., Zookeeper, Raft, Paxos)
- **Client-Server architecture** with Java
- **Multithreading & Concurrency**
- **Networking with Sockets**
- **Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)**
- **Cloud-Native concepts**
- Deploying on **AWS / Heroku / Docker**

# 🎯 Goals of This Repo

- Build a **strong foundation** in Distributed Systems with Java  
- Learn how **real-world distributed applications** are designed  
- Understand **cloud-native deployments** and **scaling**  
- Create a **reference repo** to showcase in interviews & GitHub portfolio  

---

# 🧠 Learning Style

- All code is **typed manually** (not copy-pasted), to ensure deep understanding.  
- Each section includes **notes and explanations**.  
- Mistakes and debugging steps are also documented to track my learning journey.
