# 🎯 Goals of This Repo

- Build a **strong foundation** in Distributed Systems with Java  
- Learn how **real-world distributed applications** are designed  
- Understand **cloud-native deployments** and **scaling**  
- Create a **reference repo** to showcase in interviews & GitHub portfolio  

---

# 🧠 Learning Style

- All code is **typed manually** (not copy-pasted), to ensure deep understanding.  
- Each section includes **notes and explanations**.  
- Mistakes and debugging steps are also documented to track my learning journey.
